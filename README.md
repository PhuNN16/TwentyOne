# TwentyOne
A blackjack discord bot that can be played by multiple people and the bot can be played in different servers. The bot keeps track of the players money and the amount a player has is the same in every server that the bot is in. All players start with $100 and you can gain more money by winning rounds in Blackjack or to use the +loan (amount) command. The command gives the player the amount they asked for as long as it is between 1-10,000 (both ends included). 

How to play: 
The game begins when you use the +RestlessGambler command, which brings the game into a buy in phase where anyone in the server can bet to join into the round of blackjack. Once anyone uses the +start function it begins playing the game. One player will play at a time based on the order of when they joined during buy in phase and can hit or stand when it is the user's turn. Once all players have played, the cards will be dealt for the dealer and based on the results, winnings will be distributed.
